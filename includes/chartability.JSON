We argue that alternatives should be provided such as text labels that satisfy minimum size, accompanying data tables or search functions, alternative navigation and input (such as with a keyboard or non-precise touch input), or features like zooming or filtering. While we applaud efforts such as the use of voronoi diagrams on top of visualizations, we believe that these still pose significant operability barriers for people with motor impairments.",

      "Limitations and Caveats": "Pie charts, line charts without discrete marks, and bar charts without countable isotypes all pose cognitive difficultes. Chart types that are high risk for difficulty or misinterpretation should be presented alongside alternative charts or alternative explanations and charts should be available to help the user perform the same tasks. Optionally, users should be provided control over the presentation style of these chart types (eg change pies into treemaps or stacked bars, add discrete marks to line intervals, or add countable isotypes to divide bars).",
