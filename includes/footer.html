    <p>With enough support we could develop improvements, training materials, tools, research, and more. There is already a lot of work being done in this space, but we could use some help.</p>
    <p class="hilite">Consider supporting <a href="https://www.patreon.com/frankElavsky">Frank Elavsky’s Patreon</a>, focused on data visualization and accessibility tools and research.</p>

    <h3>Want to get involved?</h3>
    <p>Nothing about us, without us! Chartability has been vetted and tested by an array of people with disabilities, including folks who are blind, low-vision, have motor impairments, cognitive impairments (ASD and AD/HD), and color vision deficiency. But even with all of that, it still could use more community contributors. The workbook’s online website is intended as the central source of collaboration and has a <a href="https://github.com/Chartability/"> Github repo</a> where community members are encouraged to open Issues for requests, feedback, and concerns. The goal is for Chartability to grow into a community-driven, community-centered piece of work.</p>
