<p>This workbook is intended to serve as a lightweight, high-level audit for catching data experience* design failures related to accessibility. For more on Chartability, see our home page: <a href="https://chartability.fizz.studio/">https://chartability.fizz.studio/</a></p>
<p>This workbook may be <a href="https://chartability.github.io/POUR-CAF/Chartability_Worksheet_V2.docx" download>downloaded as a standalone Microsoft Word document</a>, if you would like an editable file format (this is useful when keeping a record of evaluations).</p>
<p>*A data experience (DX) could refer to a data visualization such as a chart, graph, or plot, a “bespoke” (highly customized) graphic based on data, a model, or an algorithm, or a data driven interface or system.</p>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<p>This workbook organizes tests into seven categories, four of which are based on broad accessibility principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR). The last three extend Robust: Compromising, Assistive, and Flexible (CAF).</p>
<p>An auditor should proceed through each test and determine whether the content fails or succeeds using techniques provided or their own methodology. The auditor should assume failure when tests are inconclusive and (if early in the design process) a proven pass to a future consideration has not yet been demonstrated.</p>
<h2 id="failures">Failures</h2>
<p>Unlike a compliance audit (which determines adherence to regulatory guidelines), Chartability is meant to identify design failures. Generally, Chartability approaches accessibility as a scale rather than a state: how accessible a DX is is determined by how few failures it contains. It should be assumed that even the absolute best DX may contain several failures, even after remediation. Note that Chartability should never be used in place of a compliance audit but always in tandem with it.</p>
<p>Chartability’s insistence on a scale (instead of a state) of accessibility requires that designers and creators consider their choices carefully: they must be willing to argue that lack of scope, time, or research or perhaps a unique consideration led to a given failure. No failure should be left unconsidered.</p>
<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
<p>Chartability is a set of heuristic tests that not only highlights failures for remediation, but also encourages healthy design critique and critical design discourse related to accessibility. Because excellence in accessibility is never a finished state, the outcome of a Chartability audit is less about arriving at accessibility and more about working towards an accessible experience.</p>
<p>A good audit is not about measuring sucess: a good audit finds evidence of risk and failure.</p>
<h2 id="whatarecriticalheuristics">What are "Critical" heuristics?</h2>
<p>Some tests are considered <em>critical</em> by members of the community because they are prohibitively expensive to fix, common, produces signficant barriers, and/or affect many aspects of a data experience design or development.</p>
<p>While all tests in Chartability are important, it is worth noting that Chartability's community has contributed to emphasizing the tests marked critical. All data experiences should strive to have 0 critical failures as a minimum while working toward 0 failures overall.</p>

<h2 id="howdoyouusechartability">How do you use Chartability?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of different ways to perform an audit, and so there are also many different ways to use Chartability. Sometimes an audit is as casual as checking your work while you do it. And other times it is a big affair that involves teams of specialists and lawyers.</p>
<p>Realistically, while a highly trained auditor may be able to casually evaluate an artifact in as little as 30 minutes or even hold heuristics in mind as they are doing their own creative work, those new to auditing may take anywhere between 2 and 8 hours to complete a full pass of Chartability. Professional audits, which can take weeks or months, often include multiple auditors and provide rigorous documentation and detailed recommendations for remediation, typically in the form of a report. Chartability is meant to serve both quick pass and deep dive styles of audits, so users are expected to leverage it as they see fit.</p>
<p>Below we give an example of what might be a fast pass audit, using Chartability, in 5 steps. This isn't super thorough, but a good way to quickly check a handful of access barriers quickly.</p>
<h3 id="1visualtesting">1. Visual Testing</h3>
<p><img src="./images/figure1.png" alt="A dropper tool is testing the contrast of a chart and then a new chart is shown with borders that pass contrast requirements." title="Contrast testing." /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Figure 1: A low contrast chart (left) compared to a higher contrast version (right). A dropper tool is extracting the fill color of the bar and then a contrast ratio has been calculated. Note that the fill color is the same on both bars, but darker borders have been added to ensure the visualization passes contrast tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Checking for contrast is the most common critical failure across all of our audits (88% of audits failed this heuristic). In order to evaluate contrast, often a combination of automatic (code-driven) and manual tooling is performed. When manually auditing, practitioners typically use a dropper and a contrast calculator (Figure 1). Contrast is measured by finding adjacent colors that are intended to convey meaning or boundaries, and finding a ratio between them. Standards require a different minimum contrast for text (4.5:1) than geometries like marks in a chart (3:1). Most auditors find this to be one of the easiest tasks to perform, but techniques can be tricky to handle. Testing for contrast accomplishes 3 different heuristics in Chartability: ensuring text/geometries have contrast, interactive states for elements have enough contrast change, and the keyboard focus indicator is easy to distinguish.</p>
<p>Perceivable heuristics also include tests and tools for color vision deficiency and ensuring that color alone isn't used to communicate meaning (like the redundantly encoded textures in Figure 8). And another common, critical failure from Perceivable is text size. No text should be smaller than 12px/9pt in size.</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure2.png" alt="A chart with sequential keyboard navigation and a chart with keyboard navigation that can go up, down, left, and right." title="Keyboard navigation paths." /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Figure 2: Keyboard navigation paths on a stacked bar chart. The left shows a serial navigation example, typically just a default of rendering order. The right shows both groups (the stack of bars) and categories (the color/texture shared among bars across stacks) as dimensions to explore laterally or vertically.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2keyboardprobing">2. Keyboard Probing</h3>
<p>The next practice that most auditors should become comfortable with is using a keyboard to navigate and operate any functionality that is provided. Most assistive technologies, from screen readers to a variety of input devices (like switches, joysticks, sip and puffs, etc) use the keyboard api (or keyboard interface) to navigate content. If a data interface contains interactive elements (Figure 2, Figure 3), those elements (or their functionality) must be able to be reached and controlled using a keyboard alone. Auditors should be critical of how much work is involved in keyboard navigation, especially (Figure 7). All that is required to start is the auditor begins pressing the tab key to see if anything interactive comes into focus. Arrow keys, spacebar, enter, and escape may be used in some contexts. Generally, instructions or cues should always be provided.</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure3.png" alt="A chart is being selected by a mouse, updating a dataset that follows it." title="Interactive chart and dataset." /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Figure 3: A mouse cursor is selecting a bar (left, shown with a thick indication border) in a stacked bar chart to filter a dataset (on the right). A system alert (red box) notifies the user of their interaction result. This selection capability must also be provided for the keyboard interface and the alert must be announced to screen readers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using a keyboard provides an opportunity to evaluate many different heuristics: checking for multiple inputs (Figure 3), whether the data structure that is rendered is navigable according to its structure (Figure 2), and whether keyboard navigability across all elements in a data interface is even necessary (Figure 7).</p>
<h3 id="3screenreaderinspecting">3. Screen Reader Inspecting</h3>
<p>Closely related to keyboard testing is testing with a screen reader. Some things may work with a screen reader that do not with a keyboard (and vice versa), so both must be evaluated.</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure4.png" alt="A chart with an inaccessible title compared to a chart with a descriptive, takeaway title and caption." title="Using a clear takeaway title." /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Figure 4: Charts must have a visually available textual explanation provided that summarizes the outcome. "Client Registration Chart" for "Product X" (left) is inaccessible while "New Product Launch a Success" (right) gives a clear takeaway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Screen readers, unlike more basic keyboard input devices, read out content that is textual (including non-visual textual information like alternative text). Using a screen reader to audit is generally the hardest skill to learn. Keeping this in mind, testing whether the meaningful text provided in a visual (such as in Figure 4) is accessible with a screen reader is the easiest and most basic test that auditors should first perform.</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure5.png" alt="An interactive chart element that announces 'image' to a screen reader compared to an element that explains it is a toggle button and provides feedback when selected." title="Interactive chart semantics with a screen reader." /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Figure 5: An interactive chart displaying only "Image" as semantic information with no feedback provided on selection. The robust semantics given to a screen reader, "toggle button" (middle) as well instant feedback, "selected" (right) are considered proper semantics for an interactive experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, all valuable information and functionality in a data experience should tested whether it is available to a screen reader. This includes the individual variables about a mark as well as whether that mark is interactive (Figure 5), whether status updates that reflect context change provide alerts (Figure 3), and whether summary textual information is provided about the whole chart (Figure 4) as well as statistically and visually important areas of that chart (Figure 7).</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure6.png" alt="A line chart and a table, both representing the same data but at different levels of information." title="High and low levels of information." /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Figure 6: A line chart with a single line (left) and an accompanying data table (right). This line chart would not provide enough low-level information about each datapoint without the table provided. A table alone however would also be inaccessible. Providing both can satisfy conflicting accessibility needs for different audiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="4checkingcognitivebarriers">4. Checking Cognitive Barriers</h3>
<p>First, auditing for cognitive barriers generally involves checking the reading level and clarity of all available text using analytical tools. But Chartability also requires that all charts have basic text provided that provides a visually-available textual description and takeaway (Figure 4). This alone is one of the most important things to check for. In complex cases where a chart has a visual feature with an assumedly obvious takeaway, checking for annotations or textual callouts is important to help avoid interpretive issues (Figure 7).</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure7.png" alt="A dense scatterplot being navigated point-by-point and a scatterplot that allows a user to navigate to an annotation on an outlier cluster." title="Accessible annotations on a dense scatterplot." /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Figure 7: A scatterplot with many points, where a single point within the chart can be accessed by a screen reader (left). Navigating this data piece by piece is unnecessarily tedious, so an annotation callout is provided to help the reader focus on an outlier cluster (right). The callout is being accessed by a screen reader, which is displaying the annotation’s summary as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="5evaluatingcontext">5. Evaluating Context</h3>
<p>The final series of checks an auditor should make involve thinking about the overall work in a design (as it intersects with other considerations) as well as the larger technical context where the user is situated.</p>
<p>Auditors should first try to change system settings (such as toggling high contrast modes) to see whether a data experience respects these settings (Figure 8), run automatic semantic evaluations as well as manually check for appropriate meaning (Figure 5), and check if dense or highly complex visuals have sonified, tactile, or textual summaries available (Figure 7). Auditors should also check whether system updates provide clear feedback textually (Figure 3) as well as checking if there are both high and low level representations of information available (Figure 6).</p>
<p><img src="./images/figure8.png" alt="A chart compared to a version of that chart conforming to Windows' high contrast mode." title="Automatic contrast adjustment." /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Figure 8: A bar chart with categories (left) shown not conforming to Windows High Contrast White Mode. High contrast mode on Windows requires limiting color palettes, using only black or white for most elements (shown on the right).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Auditors should be especially critical of static designs, such as those where styling and presentation cannot change (like using textures by default or not, eg. Figure 8), which are a high risk of compromising and adaptive failure.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Information in the chart must be available without visuals (no screen reader/braille support). At a minimum test using JAWS + Chrome, NVDA + Firefox (on Windows), VoiceOver + Safari (on Mac), and VoiceOver + Safari (on iOS). These devices must be able to access all chart information. All annotations, “visually apparent” trends or features, and all major narrative elements must be exposed to screen readers.

<p><details><summary><i>Notes (select to expand)</i></summary><p>Testing for font size is highly complex and difficult if it isn't stored in data/metadata or known by the designer/developer.

Ongoing work for 3.0 (thanks to Myndex) is integrating contrast evaluation with "size" (roughly approximating perceptial angle), since plenty of research has shown that size affects discriminability. But as we mentioned in the contrast limitations, this work is ongoing and non-standard. For more community resources, see: https://accessibility.psu.edu/fontsizehtml/ </p></details></p>

Screen reader operability should always be tested alongside keyboard-only testing. In addition, we also should consider touch interaction. But how do we think about touch interfaces? Touch input often follows what is called the "pointer" interface, coupling mouse and touch interactions together. But touch has a much larger hit area, causing significant accessibility issues on mobile devices. This is largely an unsolved problem.</p></details></p>

Chartability does not take this design position (having a table doesn't mean everything else about a chart can pass). I've discussed in the past that tables are not enough, especially from an interactivity and navigation perspective because chart structures can represent relationships that are non-tabular. See: "Information cannot be navigated according to narrative or structure."

<p><em>This heuristic is synthesized from research</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Chart must provide a way to be navigated according to its data or narrative structure. The title, description, annotations, and then lower level data structures should be navigable and in that order. Chart data that contains sub-grouping (like a stacked bar chart) or nesting (like a treemap or hierarchy) must provide keyboard navigation that can navigate between levels and/or laterally across levels (in a non-linear fashion). Keyboard navigation must be comparable to the data structure (including cases where the data structure is novel) as well as provide linear or tabular navigation (like in a table or list).</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Chart state must be easy to share and reproduce. If an analysis or complex interaction can produce a customized view, this view must be easy to share (such as with a single link, file, or saved state).</p>

<p><details><summary><i>Notes (select to expand)</i></summary><p>Believe it or not, many complex dashboards and applications with a branching narrative or exploratory style of data interaction have no easy way to share their current state. In professional work in the past, we have found that this is a significant access barrier when an analyst digs deep into their analysis, discovers something worth sharing, and then has no easy way of sharing it. The resulting access barrier is often placed on others. It is both significant cognitive effort as well as a usability problem. Often, an analyst has to result to using a screenshot, but then the labor and "proof in the system" of the analysis is lost! In addition, screenshots are their own accessibility risk (as they must now be made accessible). We challenge engineers to consider how incredible google maps is at maintaining a user's exact parameters in a url so that if they share a link, whoever views it sees the same thing they do. The same cognitive-labor accessibility applies to other complex data interaction spaces.</p></details></p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Data must be presented at an appropriate density. If more too many elements are competing for the same space (approximate limit is based on cognitive load): clustering or patterns (or lack of) must be explained, chart must be aggregated to a higher level with less elements, or chart must be divided into smaller charts with less data.

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Trends, clusters, patterns, outliers, or significant statistical semantics and findings that are considered “visually apparent” must be described through text at a minimum. Optionally, these features may also be exposed using sonification or tactile means or through other multi-sensory approaches.</p>

<p><details><summary><i>Notes (select to expand)</i></summary><p>This heuristic is actually a significantly unsolved problem when it comes to the building materials we have available to us. Not only are sonifications or tactile experiences often authored in parallel (but separate) from visualizations (and tend to be a 1 to 1 representation), but we lack the semantic tools to describe relationships between parts (such as outliers, comparisons, trends, etc). Many efforts have attempted to automate textual descriptions, but as Lundgard et al point out, this may not be possible at a meaningful level we require in order to understand higher levels of information (see: "Accessible Visualization via Natural Language Descriptions"). This issue is related to 1.3.3 "Sensory Characteristics," but also 1.3.1 "Info and Relationships," which Brennan Young engages in a conversation on ARIA's github: https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/991#issuecomment-668493619</p></details></p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Data must be formatted to be human-readable. All textual information displayed (in data labels, annotations, axes, tables, legends, etc) must be formatted to an understandable level of content (ie “human readable”). These formats must also be made into versions that can be read and parsed comfortably by screen readers.

<p><details><summary><i>(select to read more)</i></summary><div></p>
<p><em>This heuristic is synthesized from community practices</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Use of space should appropriately handle extreme difference or similarity in the data. Both extreme quantitative differences and similarities can produce unreadable charts. If chart elements are squished into margins due to outliers or together by too much similarity, this fails. Chart must automatically handle these issues or else it must be made clear to the user through annotations what is happening. If data is dynamic or producing automatic annotations is not possible, then chart must provide a way for the user to sort, divide, or filter the chart space on their own.</p>
<p><strong>Good example</strong>: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-visualisation-principles-part-1-white-space-text-and-colour-13f520f90ce9">https://towardsdatascience.com/data-visualisation-principles-part-1-white-space-text-and-colour-13f520f90ce9</a></p>
<p><details><summary><i>Notes (select to expand)</i></summary><p>Real data is often horrible. In analytical environments, especially those where a chart format is chosen and expected to display data that is the result of a user's interaction with parameters and filters, this problem becomes common. Charts must be adaptive and flexible to the extrema in the data (grow or change to fit new parameters) but also should recognize when parameters result in data that completes for the same space (mentioned in another heuristic). If two lines are so close together that it is almost impossible to see the difference between them, a new chart type might need to be chosen or some filtering should take place instead.</p></details></p>
